# DBScan Algorithm Explained 📊

This repository contains educational materials to help you understand the DBScan (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. The aim is to provide both theoretical understanding and practical examples through PowerPoint slides and Python code. The content is a collaborative effort by [Rayan Aloufi](https://github.com/RynHb) and [Abdulmohsen Albareed](https://github.com/AbdulmohsenAlbareed). The aim is to provide both theoretical understanding and practical examples through PowerPoint slides and Python code.


## Contents 📂

- **Slides**: Explore the PowerPoint slides (e.g., "DBScan_Algorithm_Slides.pdf") to gain insights into the theoretical concepts of the DBScan algorithm, its key components, advantages, and limitations.

- **Code Example**: The Python code example (e.g., "DBScan_Example.ipynb") demonstrates how to use the DBScan algorithm for clustering using a real or synthetic dataset. The example includes data preprocessing, model application, and visualization of the results using scatter plots.

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Slides**: Download and view the PowerPoint slides to grasp the theoretical aspects of the DBScan algorithm.

2. **Code Example**: Open the provided Python code example to see the practical implementation of the DBScan algorithm using the scikit-learn library. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different datasets and hyperparameters.
